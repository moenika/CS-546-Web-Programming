                <h4>School One Elementary School</h4>
                <p> I attended School One Elementary School from 2001-2006 in Scotch Plains, 
                    New Jersey. It was the best school in the country because it was the only 
                    elementary school with air conditioning. My favorite thing about elementary
                    school was the Halloween Fair every October. My favorite class was Art.

                <h4>Park Middle School</h4>
                <p> I attended Park Middle School for one year, 2006-2007, and I hated it.
                    Every was mean and I was too nerdy, so I transferred to another school. 
                    I did not have a favorite class.

                <h4>Wardlaw Hartridge School</h4>
                <p> I transferred to a private school and loved it. Located in Edison, NJ 
                    Wardlaw Hartridge was a K-12 school, and we all wore uniforms (I was 
                    really into vests). I was first flute in the band and participated 
                    all-state choir, which was my favorite part. My favorite class was
                    music.

                <h4>Academy for Information Technology</h4>
                <p> For high school I went to a Magnet School, Union County Vocational
                    Technical School. The particular school I went to was for Computer Science.
                    I got certified in A+, Oracle, and Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. 
                    I learned a lot in high school, but there was no music in my school. I ended
                    up joining a choir outside of class, and performed at Carnegie Hall my 
                    senior year. I am in touch with all of my best friends from High school,
                    and 2 go to Stevens with me. My favorite class was Ethics.

                <h4>Stevens Institute of Technology</h4>
                <p> I am a senior Music & Technology Major with a Computer Science minor here
                    at Stevens. I have had a great 4 years, and I am sad it is ending. 
                    In my time here I am a part of the Stevens band, orchestra, choir, president's 
                    ensemble, Alpha Phi Kappa Delta Chapter, a peer mentor, and a global 
                    ambassador. I am the current President of the Stevens Computer Science Club.
                    My favorite memory at Stevens has been meeting some of my best friends, 
                    and getting to perform every week in all of my ensembles. My favorite
                    class was MIDI and Electronic Music.

                <h4>University of Westminster</h4>
                <p> My summer of my sophomore year I studied abroad in London, at the Univeristy
                    of Westminster, and it was the best 3 months of my life. I travelled to 
                    different countries each weekend and learned a lot about how to be independent
                    in unfarmiliar places. One of my favorite memories is sight seeing 
                    through the English countryside, it is beautiful! My favorite class was
                    London through it's Museums.

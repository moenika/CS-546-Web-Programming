                <p>     The Impact of Machine Learning on the Music Industry
                        <br><br>                        
                        ABSTRACT
                        <br><br>
                        Music and technology are intertwined, and together they are changing the music industry.
                        Machine learning and artificial intelligence tactics have improved the way music is listened to
                        through innovative technologies. By analyzing what a listener actively enjoys listening to
                        algorithms used by Pandora and Spotify have the ability to predict what song each person will
                        like next. The issue of possible ethical and data security problems are prevalent in this new
                        industry. The use of machine learning for music recommendation has its positives and negatives,
                        and this report analyzes this and how the algorithms used behind these recommenders can be
                        used to improve how music is listened to.

                        INTRODUCTION
                        <br><br>                        
                        There are elements of the music industry that are changing due to the innovations of
                        technologists around the world. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning; these
                        are the buzzwords of the century. These tactics are used where one least expects, and
                        surprisingly the music industry is a patron of this up and coming field. People have been
                        listening to music for centuries, and the way that people do has changed dramatically just in the
                        past year. What do people want to get out of their listening experience? Is there a way for a
                        computer to predict what songs users will enjoy based on what they currently listen to? The
                        answers lie within the algorithms of popular music recommenders and companies. Through                        
                        different methods such as deep learning, collaborative filtering, and content-based
                        recommendation, music can be chosen for a user just based on similar songs that they listen to.
                        In this thesis paper I will be exploring the power of these algorithms in regard to industry
                        standards, through my personal experience with these systems, and where they plan to be taken
                        next. Not only are there concerns for privacy with these recommenders, but there is question
                        about how far will research into this field with music go? Artificial intelligence has become so
                        powerful that it could perhaps replace musicians in certain fields of the industry simply because
                        a computer can be more efficient. I will be analyzing the current industry, where it stands in
                        technology, specifically machine learning, and where the future of this industry is going.
